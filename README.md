More Functional Facebook - Browser Extension for Google Chrome
------------------

This extension removes the newsfeed and ticker from Facebook. It also rewrites the links so that
they can be clicked to or copypasted directly, instead of getting the url that redirects through Facebook.

To install, do the following:

1. Download the crx file: https://github.com/jukvalim/more-functional-fb/raw/master/crx/more-functional-fb.crx

2. In Chrome, go to Tools->Extensions.

3. Drag the crx file to the page
