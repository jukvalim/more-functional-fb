More Functional Facebook - Browser Extension for Google Chrome
------------------
This extension hides some time-wasting, attention-baiting elements of Facebook, making it more utilitarian.

What it does
------------------

It removes the newsfeed, the ticker and the sponsored column from Facebook.
It hides the links to groups from the front page. It also rewrites links so that
they can be clicked to or copypasted directly, instead of getting redirected through Facebook.

2. In Chrome, go to Tools->Extensions.

3. Drag the crx file to the page
